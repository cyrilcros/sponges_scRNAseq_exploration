# Profiling cellular diversity in sponges informs animal cell type and nervous system evolution

This directory contains custom scripts used for analysis of single-cell RNAseq data and segmentation of FIB-SEM data in the study Musser et al. 2019,  "Profiling cellular diversity in sponges informs animal cell type and nervous system evolution"

The following directories contain:

1) `fibsem_segmentation` - scripts for automatic segementation for FIBSEM volume of choancoyte chamber containing two neuroid cells.
2) `single_cell_clustering`: scripts for clustering, gene set analysis, hierarchy tests, and cell type tree reconstruction of Spongilla single-cell RNAseq dataset.
3) `transcriptome_proteome_and_phylome`: spongilla transcriptome and proteome files, automated name lookup table, and phylome gene trees.
Additional README files are present in subdirectories, with more details explanations of individual scripts.
